### Features and How to Use

1. Interactive widgets for varying Intercept, Slope and Error priors.
2. Interactive visualization of the line of best fit and prediction with posterior Highest Density Interval.
3. Interactive summary table with datasets' statistics and R squared achieved by the linear model.
